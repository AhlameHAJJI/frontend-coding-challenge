# Front-end Coding Challenge


## Idea of application

The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below).

### Features

As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
Repository name
Repository description
Number of stars for the repo.
Number of issues for the repo.
Username and avatar of the owner.
As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination)..

### Technologies

Project is created with:
* ReactJS as a front-end javascript library.
* LESS as A dynamic preprocessor style sheet language.
* Axios as a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which allow to consume API.
* AntDesign as a React UI library that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.
* ESLint as a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
* Prettier as an opinionated code formatter.
* Git for version control
* npm for managing dependencies
